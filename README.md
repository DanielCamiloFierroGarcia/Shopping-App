# Shopping-App
Creating a shopping app in which the user can be a seller or a buyer. The seller can post products (adding name, description, tags, categories and location) he wants to sell and those products can be seen by any buyer (at a close distance to the seller) and can be added to the ´favorites´.

Also, there is the possibility for the buyer to open an in-app chat with the seller, call the seller or open SMS text. Any user can browse which products are posted, based on their tags or categories too. If the user is too far away from the location the seller designated for the product, it won't be shown.

The user can use the app to authenticate with a Google account, phone number, or email. There is also the chance not to log in, but it will be limited to only not browsing what products there are available. For any other use, it is necessary to be logged.
